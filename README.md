### What I learned

<h1>Some CSS code I'm proud of</h1>

.text {
padding : 10px 10px 10px;
border: none;
border-radius: 5px;
box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
margin: 200px 600px;
font-family: "Outfit";
font-weight: 700, 400;
text-align: center;
font-size: 15px;
background-color: white;
}

I learned a lot about CSS box model, shadows and how to organize your code.

### Continued development

I would like to learn responsive design properly, better my knowledge of CSS box model and how to use media queries.
